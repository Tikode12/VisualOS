Introducing VisualOS! 
This Apple-Inspired VSCode theme captures the sleek and minimalist design of Apple's software, with a focus on clean lines, modern typography, and an intuitive color 
palette. The background is a crisp, white tone with soft, pastel accents for syntax highlighting. The icons and overall layout emulate the familiar Apple aesthetic, 
giving you the familiar look and feel of your favorite Apple software right within your VSCode workspace.
